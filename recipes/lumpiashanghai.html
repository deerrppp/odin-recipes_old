            <li>1 pound ground chicken or pork</li>
            <li>1/2 cup green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 can (8 ounces) water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and shredded</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>20 pieces spring roll wrappers</li>
            <li>canola oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ground chicken, green onions, water chestnuts, carrots, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper until well distributed.</li>
            <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets and lay on a flat working surface.</li>
            <li>Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on the lower end of the wrapper, closest to you.</li>
            <li>Fold the bottom of wrapper over filling and continue to roll tightly into a thin log about 3/4-inch thick. Wet the remaining edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal. </li>
            <li>TRepeat with the remaining mixture. Using scissors, cut each lumpia roll into about 3-inch lengths.</li>
            <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat about 2-inch deep of oil. Add lumpia in batches and cook turning on sides as needed, for about 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crisp and meat is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup</li>
